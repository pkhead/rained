This is a level editor used to make Rain World levels.

Don't hestiate to report any bugs, complaints, and suggestions by creating an issue or
discussion thread on GitHub, or contacting me through Discord. I am in several Rain
World modding Discord servers, and I have my own server as well:
https://discord.gg/raUQ4yRH9F. You may either ping me in a relevant channel in the server
of your choice or DM me (they are open).

You may also join my Discord server if you find announcement channels a conveninent way
of keeping track of Rained news and updates.

If you send a crash report, please send me the contents of logs/latest.log.txt
before relaunching the program.

Also, if you are on Windows and Rained fails to even open a window when launching it,
it's probably because you are missing the Microsoft Visual Studio C++ runtime package.
It can be installed here: (aka.ms is a domain owned by Microsoft, btw.)
    https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

The manual can be found by going to one of these two sources:
- https://pkhead.github.io/rained/en/
- docs/index.html  (can also be opened inside the app)

Hope you enjoy!
