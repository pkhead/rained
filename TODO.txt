Selection:
- selection undo/redo
- layer masking
- drag for tile select
- bounds checking?
- add buttons to edit menu
- add select/copy/paste shortcuts to shortcut window

Bugs:
- undoing while chain holder attach makes a crash .. ???
- reported issue of lag building up over time... speeds up when opened a room with a lot of props
- reported increased usage while computer is locked
- reported crash in asset manager due to queues or something
- asset manager merging is actually kind of buggy
- don't clip mirror lines to scissor box
- errors when rendering new effects???
- using keyboards shortcuts while rendering does weird things
  fix: disable shortcuts while rendering

v2.3.0:
  * geo/tile copy+paste (i am currently working on this),
  - tile & effect prefabs
  - favorite tiles&props
  - material previews
  - render single camera
  - prop editor lasso select ()
  - translation system
  - effects previews
  - show prop preview over mouse
  - second layer for keybinds
  - make brush strength independent of refresh rate
  - Rotation props (#29)
  - autotiles
    - option to join only inner tiles
    - ability to recognize more than one tile as a direction type
    - cross beams autotile
      - ability to constrain autotile shape into a square
    - expose imgui functions for scripting api
    - add re-path button (useful for autotiles that do random)

Do Soon:
- toggle for showing shortcuts in tile editor

Do Later:
- popup menu for view toggle
- optional download from seroen's repo
- FIX BLENDING OF PROPS IN TILE EDITOR !!!!!! (wait it's broken?)

Do Sometime:
- asset manager crap
- method of generating approximated geometry from prop

v2.4.0 (or v3.0.0, depending on the frequency of major updates):
- Fully FeatuerdWorld editor

Other features:
- effects save/load presets/prefabs
- light map stretch
- asset manager
  - can rearrange the order of stuff in asset manager
  - can change color in asset manager
  - fix merging
  - can select certain packs from solar repo?
- autosave
- optimize tile deform rendering
- prop selection box is affected by bfTiles (don't do this, also make optional from preferences. is this possible?)
- material previews. henry said i shouldn't try it because it will make the leditor very slow but I Don't Care.
  (i  mean i do care, i just think i can make it run reasonably fast by using spatial partitioning)
- Move Level
- undo/redo for level resize
- level resze drag
- level resize change history
- put asterik in window title for unsaved levels
- allow user to open levels with unrecognized tiles/props
  without erasing unrecognized assets
  - so need to figure out how to store tiles/props by name only instead of
    by init reference... probably could use an ID system and most IDs are
    a reference to a tile but some IDs are for placeholders.

Geometry Editor:
- show tool preview over mouse

Light Editor:
- toggle view shadow plane and occlusion plane
- prop/tile as brush

Effects Editor:
- WASD navigation
- only store the pixels that changed in the matrix
- make brush density not dependent on refresh rate

Prop Editor:
- do tile as prop depth change based on if specs2 is active?
- More tiles are located in startUp.lingo... also check out initDRInternal in comEditorUtils.lingo
- correct flipping of multiple props or freeform props
  freeform props should flip about the center of the AABB
