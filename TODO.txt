Selection:
- selection undo/redo
- drag for tile select
- ability to move selected in-between layers

LargeTexture:
- large texture for lightmap

Bugs:
- undoing while chain holder attach makes a crash .. ???
- reported issue of lag building up over time... speeds up when opened a room with a lot of props
- reported increased usage while computer is locked
- reported crash in asset manager due to queues or something
- asset manager merging is actually kind of buggy
- don't clip mirror lines to scissor box
- errors when rendering new effects???
- using keyboards shortcuts while rendering does weird things
  fix: disable shortcuts while rendering

v2.3.0:
  - Lightmap stretch (ditto) & move
  * geo/tile copy+paste (i am currently working on this),
  - tile & effect prefabs
  - favorite tiles&props
  - material previews
  - render single camera
  - prop editor lasso select ()
  - translation system
  - effects previews
  - show prop preview over mouse
  - second layer for keybinds
  - Rotation props (#29)
  - autotiles
    - option to join only inner tiles
    - ability to recognize more than one tile as a direction type
    - cross beams autotile
      - ability to constrain autotile shape into a square
    - expose imgui functions for scripting api
    - add re-path button (useful for autotiles that do random)

Do Soon:
- toggle for showing shortcuts in tile editor

Do Later:
- popup menu for view toggle
- optional download from seroen's repo
- FIX BLENDING OF PROPS IN TILE EDITOR !!!!!! (wait it's broken?)

Do Sometime:
- asset manager crap
- method of generating approximated geometry from prop

v2.4.0 (or v3.0.0, depending on the frequency of major updates):
- Fully FeatuerdWorld editor

Other features:
- effects save/load presets/prefabs
- light map stretch
- asset manager
  - can rearrange the order of stuff in asset manager
  - can change color in asset manager
  - fix merging
  - can select certain packs from solar repo?
- autosave
- optimize tile deform rendering
- prop selection box is affected by bfTiles (don't do this, also make optional from preferences. is this possible?)
- material previews. henry said i shouldn't try it because it will make the leditor very slow but I Don't Care.
  (i  mean i do care, i just think i can make it run reasonably fast by using spatial partitioning)
- Move Level
- undo/redo for level resize
- level resze drag
- level resize change history
- put asterik in window title for unsaved levels
- allow user to open levels with unrecognized tiles/props
  without erasing unrecognized assets
  - so need to figure out how to store tiles/props by name only instead of
    by init reference... probably could use an ID system and most IDs are
    a reference to a tile but some IDs are for placeholders.

Geometry Editor:
- show tool preview over mouse

Light Editor:
- toggle view shadow plane and occlusion plane
- prop/tile as brush

Effects Editor:
- WASD navigation
- only store the pixels that changed in the matrix

Prop Editor:
- do tile as prop depth change based on if specs2 is active?
- More tiles are located in startUp.lingo... also check out initDRInternal in comEditorUtils.lingo
- correct flipping of multiple props or freeform props
  freeform props should flip about the center of the AABB

Tile graphics atlasing:

Regular colors you already know
rgb(255,0,0) —> shadow
rgb(0,255,0) —> midtone
rgb(0,0,255) —> highlight
rgb(255,255,0) —> same as midtone, only used in color2 window

Dark colors, they always use the non-sunlit part of the palette and also use the front of it. Used by platforms and roof houses.
rgb(150,0,0) —> dark shadow
rgb(0,150,0) —> dark midtone
rgb(0,0,150) —> dark highlight

The regular effect colors, they fade to midtone color
rgb(255,0,255) —> color A
rgb(0,255,255) —> color B

There’s more though! There’s versions for highlight and shadow as well. (as in they fade to that color instead of midtone)
rgb(255,150,255) —> highlight color A
rgb(150,255,255) —> highlight color B
rgb(150,0,150) —> shadow color A
rgb(0,150,150) —> shadow color B

What’s the gigantic singular case you might then ask? Any color rgb(x,255,150) turns into batfly hive white, fading from I think it’s midtone to white based on the red channel
