LargeTexture:
- large texture for lightmap

- If youre in the autotile tab and remove a tile and then undo, that removed tile doesnt get re-added.
oh also clicking on a category doesnt select any tile in that category so using w and s to navigate does so in the category that was selected previosly

- Chain holder: when placing one, it lets you drag the chain to a specific point, which works as intended, however when you cancel it (with right mouse button), it deletes the tile it is hovering over, which can get quite annoying, especially if there isnt much/any air around to safely cancel the chain. was that intended behaviour or something?

- undoing while chain holder attach makes a crash .. ???
- reported issue of lag building up over time... speeds up when opened a room with a lot of props
- reported increased usage while computer is locked
- reported crash in asset manager due to queues or something
- asset manager merging is actually kind of buggy
- don't clip mirror lines to scissor box
- errors when rendering new effects???
- using keyboards shortcuts while rendering does weird things
  fix: disable shortcuts while rendering

v2.4.0:
  - tile & effect prefabs
  - favorite tiles&props
  - material previews
  - render single camera
  - translation system
  - effects previews
  - show prop preview over mouse
  - second layer for keybinds
  - Rotation props (#29)
  - scripting system
    - autotiles
      - option to join only inner tiles
      - ability to recognize more than one tile as a direction type
      - expose imgui functions for scripting api
      - add re-path button (useful for autotiles that do random)
  - prop editor lasso select

Scripting API:
- fix log of nlua exception thrown in command run
- make lua autotiles not use NLua classes
- effect layer accept lingo names
- make C# function wrappers always use closures rather than userdata
  (so that type(func) is not userdata when it's a function...)

Do Soon:
- Add geo big slope to manual
- toggle for showing shortcuts in tile editor
- tile graphics ludo's seamless tile types?
- could there be an option to change the move confirm shortcut? my laptop preset has change layer on enter so would be very useful for me if it’s ok ^^
  (I don't know about adding this because does this mean i need to change all submit keybinds? I'd rather be consistent. ANd why has this user bound layer change to enter??)

Do Later:
- popup menu for view toggle
- optional download from solar's repo
- FIX BLENDING OF PROPS IN TILE EDITOR !!!!!! (wait it's broken?)

Do Sometime:
- method of generating approximated geometry from prop

v3.0.0:
- Fully FeatuerdWorld editor

Other features:
- asset manager
  - can select certain packs from solar repo?
- autosave
- optimize tile deform rendering (use vertex shader) (maybe?)
- prop selection box is affected by bfTiles (don't do this, also make optional from preferences. is this possible?)
- material previews. henry said i shouldn't try it because it will make the leditor very slow but I Don't Care.
  (i  mean i do care, i just think i can make it run reasonably fast by using spatial partitioning)
- Move Level
- undo/redo for level resize
- level resze drag
- level resize change history
- allow user to open levels with unrecognized tiles/props
  without erasing unrecognized assets
  - so need to figure out how to store tiles/props by name only instead of
    by init reference... probably could use an ID system and most IDs are
    a reference to a tile but some IDs are for placeholders.

Geometry Editor:
- show tool preview over mouse

Light Editor:
- toggle view shadow plane and occlusion plane
- prop/tile as brush

Effects Editor:
- WASD navigation
- only store the pixels that changed in the matrix

Prop Editor:
- do tile as prop depth change based on if specs2 is active?
- More tiles are located in startUp.lingo... also check out initDRInternal in comEditorUtils.lingo
- correct flipping of multiple props or freeform props
  freeform props should flip about the center of the AABB

Tile graphics atlasing:
(hm... not really looking much into this anymore since i realized that it doesn't really work
with z-buffering. unless i have a tesellation shader or something Idk. Could potentially have this
an optional optimization option, however.)

Regular colors you already know
rgb(255,0,0) —> shadow
rgb(0,255,0) —> midtone
rgb(0,0,255) —> highlight
rgb(255,255,0) —> same as midtone, only used in color2 window

Dark colors, they always use the non-sunlit part of the palette and also use the front of it. Used by platforms and roof houses.
rgb(150,0,0) —> dark shadow
rgb(0,150,0) —> dark midtone
rgb(0,0,150) —> dark highlight

The regular effect colors, they fade to midtone color
rgb(255,0,255) —> color A
rgb(0,255,255) —> color B

There’s more though! There’s versions for highlight and shadow as well. (as in they fade to that color instead of midtone)
rgb(255,150,255) —> highlight color A
rgb(150,255,255) —> highlight color B
rgb(150,0,150) —> shadow color A
rgb(0,150,150) —> shadow color B

What’s the gigantic singular case you might then ask? Any color rgb(x,255,150) turns into batfly hive white, fading from I think it’s midtone to white based on the red channel
