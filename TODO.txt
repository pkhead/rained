DRAWTEXT!

Priority:
- configurable tile spec colors
- "General" and "Current" shortcut split
- dissolve material/tile separation
- editorConfig.txt
- rect/material tile place

Bugs:
- drizzle doesn't build correctly on mac?
- change history doesn't work well with level resize
- fix weird bug where keyboard release doesn't get registered
- weird graphical issue on certain drivers when level is out of bounds

Overall:
- figure out github actions to make nightly builds
- favorite tiles and props
- move away from Raylib, perhaps use a single windowing/graphics library like SFML or Silk.NET or Veldrid
- auto-recovery saves (main problem is figuring out how to do it non-blocking)
  - probably just create a copy of the level on the main thread, and save it on another? still would probably freeze app for a bit
- port newmakelevel (geometry exporter) to C#
- Move Level
- level preview in file browser
- undo/redo for level resize
- level resze drag
- help pages/hints/tooltips/whatever
- tile cat# and index# saving is probably incorrect
- option to use "legacy" shortcut icons

Geometry Editor:
- select and copy/paste
- show tool preview over mouse
- select and move geometry (make in conjunction with copy/paste)
- keyboard shortcut for shortcut & shortcut dots

Tile Editor:
- make 2nd geo spec layer a lighter red 
- optimize tile rendering
- force geo on materials (hm... what if i combined geo/tile editor?)

Camera Editor:
- render order

Light Editor:
- save intermediate textures for change history
  (i guess once per every 1000 stroke atoms or something)
- toggle view shadow plane and occlusion plane
- prop/tile as brush

Effects Editor:
- WASD navigation
- only store the pixels that changed in the matrix

Prop Editor:
- do tile as prop depth change based on if specs2 is active?
- More tiles are located in startUp.lingo... also check out initDRInternal in comEditorUtils.lingo
- correct flipping of multiple props or freeform props
  freeform props should flip about the center of the AABB
- randomFlipX and randomFlipY tags

Render:
- select camera to render first
- show time elapsed
