Priority:
- configurable tile spec colors
- dissolve material/tile separation
- editorConfig.txt

Bugs:
- change history doesn't work well with level resize
- fix weird bug where keyboard release doesn't get registered
- weird graphical issue on certain drivers when level is out of bounds
  - already figured this out, fix is on the glib branch (though doesn't actually require glib)

Overall:
- client code mouse position doesn't work with multi-viewports
- new level screen
- favorite tiles and props
- move away from Raylib, perhaps use a single windowing/graphics library like SFML or Silk.NET or Veldrid
- auto-recovery saves (main problem is figuring out how to do it non-blocking)
  - probably just create a copy of the level on the main thread, and save it on another? still would probably freeze app for a bit
- port newmakelevel (geometry exporter) to C#
- Move Level
- undo/redo for level resize
- level resze drag
- help pages/hints/tooltips/whatever
- tile cat# and index# saving is probably incorrect
- option to use "legacy" shortcut icons

Geometry Editor:
- mirror tool
- select and copy/paste
- show tool preview over mouse
- select and move geometry (make in conjunction with copy/paste)
- keyboard shortcut for shortcut & shortcut dots

Tile Editor:
- make 2nd geo spec layer a lighter red

Camera Editor:
- render order
  - cameras show a number on the top left corner of their bounds (this is the render order)
  - you can change the render order in the Edit menu with the "Set First" button

Light Editor:
- save intermediate textures for change history
  (i guess once per every 1000 stroke atoms or something)
   - this is to save cpu time when undo-ing if someone potentially had
   - a very large change history for the light editor. (is this even possible)
- toggle view shadow plane and occlusion plane
- prop/tile as brush

Effects Editor:
- WASD navigation
- only store the pixels that changed in the matrix

Prop Editor:
- do tile as prop depth change based on if specs2 is active?
- More tiles are located in startUp.lingo... also check out initDRInternal in comEditorUtils.lingo
- correct flipping of multiple props or freeform props
  freeform props should flip about the center of the AABB

Render:
- show time elapsed
