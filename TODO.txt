LargeTexture:
- large texture for lightmap

oh also clicking on a category doesnt select any tile in that category so using w and s to navigate does so in the category that was selected previosly
  (should i fix this?)

- undoing while chain holder attach makes a crash .. ???
- reported issue of lag building up over time... speeds up when opened a room with a lot of props
- reported increased usage while computer is locked
- don't clip mirror lines to scissor box
- errors when rendering new effects???
- using keyboards shortcuts while rendering does weird things
  fix: disable shortcuts while rendering
- make prop size query only scan PNG headers instead of loading the whole thing

v2.4.0:
  - tile & effect prefabs
  - favorite tiles&props
  - material previews
  - render single camera
  - translation system
  - effects previews
  - show prop preview over mouse
  - second layer for keybinds
  - Rotation props (#29)
  - scripting system
    - autotiles
      - option to join only inner tiles
      - ability to recognize more than one tile as a direction type
      - expose imgui functions for scripting api
      - add re-path button (useful for autotiles that do random)
  - prop editor lasso select

Scripting API:
- fix log of nlua exception thrown in command run
- make lua autotiles not use NLua classes
- effect layer accept lingo names
- make C# function wrappers always use closures rather than userdata
  (so that type(func) is not userdata when it's a function...)

Do Soon:
- layer 4 maker
- Add geo big slope to manual
- toggle for showing shortcuts in tile editor
- tile graphics ludo's seamless tile types?
- could there be an option to change the move confirm shortcut? my laptop preset has change layer on enter so would be very useful for me if it’s ok ^^
  (I don't know about adding this because does this mean i need to change all submit keybinds? I'd rather be consistent. ANd why has this user bound layer change to enter??)

Do Later:
- popup menu for view toggle
- optional download from solar's repo
- FIX BLENDING OF PROPS IN TILE EDITOR !!!!!! (wait it's broken?)

Do Sometime:
- method of generating approximated geometry from prop

v3.0.0:
- Fully FeatuerdWorld editor

Other features:
- organizable favorites per region prefix
    (probbly could extend scripting api to make this possible?)
- asset manager
  - can select certain packs from solar repo?
- autosave
- optimize tile deform rendering (use vertex shader) (maybe?)
- prop selection box is affected by bfTiles (don't do this, also make optional from preferences. is this possible?)
- material previews. henry said i shouldn't try it because it will make the leditor very slow but I Don't Care.
  (i  mean i do care, i just think i can make it run reasonably fast by using spatial partitioning)
- Move Level
- undo/redo for level resize
- level resze drag
- level resize change history
- allow user to open levels with unrecognized tiles/props
  without erasing unrecognized assets
  - so need to figure out how to store tiles/props by name only instead of
    by init reference... probably could use an ID system and most IDs are
    a reference to a tile but some IDs are for placeholders.

Geometry Editor:
- show tool preview over mouse

Light Editor:
- toggle view shadow plane and occlusion plane
- prop/tile as brush

Effects Editor:
- WASD navigation
- only store the pixels that changed in the matrix

Prop Editor:
- do tile as prop depth change based on if specs2 is active?
- More tiles are located in startUp.lingo... also check out initDRInternal in comEditorUtils.lingo
- correct flipping of multiple props or freeform props
  freeform props should flip about the center of the AABB

Tile graphics atlasing:
(hm... not really looking much into this anymore since i realized that it doesn't really work
with z-buffering. unless i have a tesellation shader or something Idk. Could potentially have this
an optional optimization option, however.)

Regular colors you already know
rgb(255,0,0) —> shadow
rgb(0,255,0) —> midtone
rgb(0,0,255) —> highlight
rgb(255,255,0) —> same as midtone, only used in color2 window

Dark colors, they always use the non-sunlit part of the palette and also use the front of it. Used by platforms and roof houses.
rgb(150,0,0) —> dark shadow
rgb(0,150,0) —> dark midtone
rgb(0,0,150) —> dark highlight

The regular effect colors, they fade to midtone color
rgb(255,0,255) —> color A
rgb(0,255,255) —> color B

There’s more though! There’s versions for highlight and shadow as well. (as in they fade to that color instead of midtone)
rgb(255,150,255) —> highlight color A
rgb(150,255,255) —> highlight color B
rgb(150,0,150) —> shadow color A
rgb(0,150,150) —> shadow color B

What’s the gigantic singular case you might then ask? Any color rgb(x,255,150) turns into batfly hive white, fading from I think it’s midtone to white based on the red channel
