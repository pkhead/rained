GEO EDITOR SELECT-COPY-PASTE

Bugs:
- loading a new level with the prop editor open will load light map data incorrectly?
- crashes when calling UnloadMesh on Debian Linux 

Overall:
- keyboard replacements for scroll wheel stuff
- auto-recovery saves (main problem is figuring out how to do it non-blocking)
  - probably just create a copy of the level on the main thread, and save it on another? still would probably freeze app for a bit
- combine geo and tile editor
- configurable geo colors
- configurable keybinds
- revamp shortcut system (prefer shortcuts over raw IsKeypressed)
- check for latest version using https://api.github.com/repos/pkhead/rained/releases/latest
- Move Level
- undo/redo for level resize
- help pages/hints/tooltips/whatever
- Edit/View menu buttons for specific editors
  e.g. New Camera button in camera editor,
  no copy/paste in light/effects editor
- tile cat# and index# saving is probably incorrect
- favorite tiles and props
- fix trans flag prop loading
- option to use "legacy" shortcut icons
- CUSTOM MATERIALS

Geometry Editor:
- select and copy/paste
- show tool preview over mouse
- mirror
- select and move geometry (make in conjunction with copy/paste)
- ability to view tiles (hm... what if i combined geo/tile editor?)
- right-click to remove cells/objects
- keyboard shortcut for shortcut & shortcut dots
- optimized cell change recorder
  (i.e. record specific changes in user code instead of scanning the entire level for such)
  (though, after implementing LevelCell.Equals manually, the pause is barely noticeable)

NOTE: shortcut entrances always have an object of type 4. (dunno why, probably some leftovers from an older impl)

Tile Editor:
- make 2nd geo spec layer a lighter red 
- optimize tile rendering
- rect material/tile place
- customizable autotiling (what's a way to do this without scripting?)
- force geo on materials (hm... what if i combined geo/tile editor?)
- G+right click is buggy with specs2 (really?)
- category colors

Camera Editor:
- render order
- camera snap

Light Editor:
- save intermediate textures for change history
  (i guess once per every 1000 stroke atoms or something)
- toggle view shadow plane and occlusion plane

Effects Editor:
- only store the pixels that changed in the matrix

Prop Editor:
- do tile as prop depth change based on if specs2 is active?
- bug when resizing: PointA and PointB do not update?
- More tiles are located in startUp.lingo... also check out initDRInternal in comEditorUtils.lingo
- correct flipping of multiple props or freeform props
  freeform props should flip about the center of the AABB

Render:
- select camera to render first
- show time elapsed
- show light render stage
- if possible, show coloring stage, although i don't think
  drizzle has the code required to show that?

tile data format (from rwe+):
    {"tp": "tileHead", "data": ["point(C, T)", "N"]}
    C = Category ID (starting from 1) plus 2 (Stone = 3, Machinery = 15, Misc = 12)
    T = Tile index starting from 1
    N = tile name

    {"tp": "tileBody", "data": ["PT", L]}
    PT = location of the tile head plus (1, 1)
    L = layer

    {"tp": "material", "data": "N"}
    N = material name

    {"tp": "default": "data": 0}
