Rained is a tool used to make Rain World levels.

The online version of this documentation is for the latest release version. If you have an older version, you should look at the local copy of the documentation which can be opened from the app.

If you are on Windows and Rained fails to even open a window when launching it, you should read [the Dependencies section of this page](install-updates.md#dependencies).

Don't hestiate to report any bugs, complaints, and suggestions by creating an issue or discussion thread on GitHub, or contacting me through Discord. I am in several Rain World modding Discord servers, and I have my own server as well. You may either ping me in a relevant channel in the server of your choice or DM me (they are open).

You may also join my Discord server if you find announcement channels a conveninent way of keeping track of Rained news and updates.

Hope you enjoy!
